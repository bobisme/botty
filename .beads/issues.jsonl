The only parties are the client and server, both running as you.\n\n2. **Direction matters** - The \"confusion\" would be PTY output (from agent → client) being misinterpreted as server control messages. But PTY output flows in one direction after attach starts—there's no parsing of it as JSON.\n\n3. **In practice it works** - The initial JSON response is read before entering the raw I/O bridge. After that, everything is just PTY data forwarded to stdout.\n\n4. **Proper fix is expensive** - Length-prefixed framing or out-of-band signaling would require protocol changes, version negotiation, and client/server coordination.

Additionally, PID reuse attacks are possible - if the original process dies and another process takes its PID, you'll signal the wrong process.\n\n## Current Decision: Won't Fix\n\nDeclined because:\n\n1. **Threat model mismatch** - botty is local IPC over a Unix socket. The server runs as the same user, on the same machine. If an attacker can compromise the server or MITM the socket, they already have code execution as your user—sending SIGWINCH to a process is the least of your problems.\n\n2. **We control the PID source** - The PID comes from our own spawn operation. The server tracks which PIDs it spawned. There's no external input.\n\n3. **SIGWINCH is benign** - Even if somehow the wrong process received it, SIGWINCH just tells a process \"your terminal resized.\" Most processes ignore it entirely. It can't cause privilege escalation or data corruption.\n\n4. **Fix would add complexity** - Moving signaling server-side means the server needs to track which attach clients want resize notifications, adding state and message types for minimal security benefit.\n\n## If Revisited\nIf botty ever supports remote connections or multi-user scenarios, this should be reconsidered.
